Sometimes your brain will play tricks on you. Social network websites know about these effects very well
and turn you into an ADD suffering individual much faster than you would expect. So this is intended to be a collection of
scripts and various files that will "turn the lights off" hopefully helping you focus more and be more productive
when you really need to. For me the main "bug" appears when I would quickly open lets say fb just to check for something "new"
and close it back while in the middle of some work, which is quite innocent at first, but then it would quickly accumulate throughout the day and
lowers productivity for things like programming quite a lot.
